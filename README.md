# Irregular Heartbeat Detection using a Convolution Neural Network

## Motivation
Sudden cardiac death (SCD) and arrhythmia represent a major worldwide public health problem, accounting for 15-20\% of all deaths. An estimated of 17.7 million sudden cardiac deaths occur annually, world wide. Although single single arrhythmia heartbeats may not have a serious impact on ones living condition, prolonged arrhythmia beats can lead to fatal circumstances. Traditional ways of detecting and classifying Arrhythmia by doctors are time consuming and in some cases, not very accurate. A lot of research has been done, and is still underway, in order to aid doctors to identify irregularities in heartbeats. This project aims on making a 2-Dimensional Convolution Neural Network that is trained on the MIT-BIH data-set so that it can classify irregularities occurring in heartbeats in a more sophisticated manner.
